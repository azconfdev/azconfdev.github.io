    With the emergence of DevOps / SRE / Agile methods of application deployment and management, infrastructure and configuration as code (IaC and CaC) are the most discussed topics in the cloud and cloud native space. There are many platforms and tools that enable IaC for different on-prem and cloud application architectures. Terraform stands in a unique position here with support for many cloud platforms and on-prem applications. The consistent manner in which you create and use Terraform configurations makes it one of the most adopted tools for IaC across multiple cloud providers. However, like with any other technology, being able to use a tool is different from using it effectively and efficiently.

    This workshop introduces you to Hashicorp Terraform, walks you through all the concepts to get you started with using Terraform, and explains the best practices in implementing Azure deployments using Terraform. This workshop includes a set of hands on labs that you can try and learn the concepts as you proceed in the workshop.

    **Topics Covered**
    - Infrastructure As Code Fundamentals
    - What is Terraform
    - Getting started with Terraform and Azure
    - Building complex Azure Infrastructure using Terraform
    - CI and CD of Terraform configurations

    **Pre-requisites**
    - Azure Subscription and a computer to try out workshop exercises
    
    **Free Azure infrastructure will be provided to attendees for a limited period of time to try out**

They work (mostly) and are a logical solution to your application's data management needs. They've been the standard and that's what's always worked. And then...NoSQL databases came along. You may find that you're now in a spiral of questions: What is this? Is this better than a relational database? What do we need another database technology for? Does this mean there's no structured query language? Do I migrate my existing database to this model? In this talk, I'll answer these questions (and many more) to help you understand the what, how, and why of NoSQL databases as it relates to the modern applications we strive to build today. You'll leave with a definitive guide on NoSQL databases and be confident in deciding whether or not it is the right database solution for you!",

By automating workflows, CI/CD, and other common tasks, Actions greatly simplifies and improves developer workflows and productivity. One of the scenarios where actions play a significant role is setting Azure infrastructure using code. We can use arm-deploy action for the same. Arm-deploy is a GitHub Action to deploy ARM templates which adds maturity to pipelines. In the session, we'll discuss about github actions, workflows and focus on arm-deploy action to setup azure infrastructure.",

With the rise of Blackbox models, ML Solutions based on them are often blamed for lack of transparency and hence its trustworthiness on fairness is being questioned. In some of the countries, the law of the land requires the organization that owns the ML Models to explain its predictions. Hence it’s high time for Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists to practice Interpretable ML which is also referred to as Explainable AI (XAI). This talk helps you understand the following:What is Interpretable ML / Explainable AI ? Why is Interpretability required in Machine Learning? How is it relevant to me?

The first part of the talk introduces MongoDB Realm and explains how it can accelerate the development process and help you Build apps fast and Build them right. The second part demonstrates how easy it is to use MongoDB Realm in a web application, in this case, Angular. All it takes few lines of codes to add authentication, save data, create an index for faster fetch, etc. You will learn to write that code in a step-by-step manner. The third part teaches you to use Azure Cognitive Services to find emotions in the notes, and in the end, we will deploy the app on azure web apps. This talk is for any developer who knows little concepts of NoSQL, cloud, and JavaScript. The main take away of the talk will be understanding various components of an app from storage to development to analysis.

To take full advantage of the serverless benefits of event-driven, your application needs to scale and react to those events instantly. It needs to be able to scale from zero to potentially thousands of instances. KEDA is an open-sourced component that provides event-driven autoscaling for your Kubernetes workloads. KEDA works with any container, but to enable additional serverless capabilities within Kubernetes you can pair KEDA with the Azure Functions runtime. Don't get fooled by 'Azure' in the name. Azure Functions provides a programming model that can run anywhere: in a container running on-premises, fully managed in Azure, or in any Kubernetes cluster and they can be written in many languages. It allows application developers not to worry anymore about writing the code to connect, trigger, and pull from an event source like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Azure Event Hubs. That’s all handled for you. In this demo-filled session, we will start with a quick introduction to both Kubernetes and Azure Functions. You will then see how you can create your first cluster and install KEDA, deploy a function and scale that to thousands of instances based on events.",

Controlling resource deployments on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster can quickly become challenging, particularly when multiple Continuous Delivery pipelines target the same cluster. In such scenarios, you want to build smarts within the Kubernetes cluster to admit or deny pods that do not meet your admission criteria. With Azure Policy for AKS, you can write static admission rules for your Kubernetes cluster. But what if your admission demands are dynamic or you want to roll out custom admission policies? By creating custom admission webhooks for Kubernetes, you can define custom policies that regulate the deployment of resources to a cluster. In this session, we will present how you can administer Azure Policies for AKS and subsequently build a serverless validating admission webhook with Azure Functions to apply governance policies on the deployments in Kubernetes. Azure Functions allow you to integrate with external services without writing a single line of integration code. We will use the Azure Function’s native Twilio binding to send SMS updates on Kubernetes deployments to the Ops/SRE team. After participating in this session, you will understand how easy it is to write custom validating webhooks for Kubernetes. Also, you will learn to build and deploy a serverless infrastructure to certify deployments at scale.",

If you are a leader (or aspire to be one), a member of a team (or may be in one in the future), or a just looking to develop your skills, this talk (based on Tuckman's model, but with fresh angle) will give you a practical framework with actionable tips for working in and leading teams successfully. You'll learn about the five phases — Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning — including detailed descriptions of each along with proven strategies for addressing challenges or issues that may occur along the way. You'll understand how to use the model to your advantage by effectively navigating all of the phases, from team set-up to the after-party!",

We will be learning the pillars of WAF with demos to visualize better. I am sure, you will start implement some of them on the same day once you the gap. Cloud is a moving target as they keep improvise or update the stuff all the time. How can someone tell me cloud adoption maturity and comment the gap?

It would be great if someone could create a simple application that gets real-time bus information, also allowing the creation of geofence: when the bus enters that area, you know it’s time to leave the office. You can catch the bus right on time and never have to wait for the next one! I’ve been using it for more than a year now and it…just works. Like magic. With the aid of Azure Function, Azure SQL and a service like IFTTT, creating such solutions is fun, and paves the way for improvements and integrations that make people’s lives easier.

In this session we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You will also see what it takes to develop distributed applications in .NET Core using Dapr's features and how to bind to messaging infrastructure, cloud resources and use the actor programming model and client proxies. At the end you know what it takes to combine Dapr in your ASP.NET Core applications using routing, controllers or using gRPC clients.",

    **Session : Build high-performance APIs with gRPC and .NET**
sessiontitle: |
   gRPC is a modern high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework with excellent cross-platform support. gRPC is based on HTTP/2, Protocol Buffers, and other modern standards-based technologies. Together with excellent tooling, gRPC helps you create high throughput, low latency, real-time services.

    In this talk, I'll introduce gRPC and compare it with familiar REST-based JSON APIs. You will see how to create gRPC services on ASP.NET Core, and how to integrate gRPC with dependency injection, logging, and authentication. Learn how to use gRPC to create lightning-fast microservices and front-end applications.

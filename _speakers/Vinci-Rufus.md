    **Session : Deploying Micro Frontends to a Kubernetes Cluster**
    
sessiontitle: |
    Micro frontends are a rage, but teams generally struggle with trying to deploy their Micro Frontends on to a Production Environment. This talk will walk you through an end to end process of setting up a micro frontend app using mono repos and trunk-based development and how do we go about setting up a CI & CD pipeline for deploying it into an AKS cluster using Azure DevOps.
    
    We will also look at Review Apps to create feature environments for every PR thats raised.

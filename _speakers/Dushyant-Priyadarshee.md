    **Session : How to automate network security for your Azure functions**
sessiontitle: |
    Azure functions can be kept secured with restricted access setup or Azure AD based authentication etc. We will see some basic access control to secure an Azure function. Then we will use dotnet based Azure function as an example to describe an ecosystem. There will be few Azure tech introductions e.g. Azure event grid, resource graph explorer etc and few demos with a dotnet core Azure function. Overall we will discuss and design the architecture of a system automating the network security for the ecosystem with multiple Azure functions. This idea can be spanned to a more complex environment, we might touch on that.

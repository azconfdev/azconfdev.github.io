    Anchal comes with specialization in Computer Science and a solid experience in IoT, Analytics and Augmented Reality solutions across domains I aim to use it for determining the best solutions for business development. I have specialized in web development, worked on beacons and created many multi-lingual platforms. This gave me opportunity to part of two international angular conferences. Being a technologist, I got chance to be virtually speaking in University Of Toronto for directing students to technology. Soon I involved myself into IoT, developing smart home applications and thus leading my way to PTC, which gave me huge platform to play around with IoT, Analytics and Augmented Reality. Apart from learning, I also aim in contributing to the community through my personnel blog where I wrote about basic concepts about angular and now focusing to write more on other technologies.

    **Session : "Plan your unplanned downtime"**
sessiontitle: |
    We find large number of manufacturers and industries, failing or spending huge amount of money due to unexpected downtime. The machines shuts creating the entire line on shop floor inactive, thereby stopping production or assembly in assembly lines. This results in halt in production, calling maintenance engineer for corrective solution, adding new machines if earlier cant be repaired and might be missing customer deadline. This loss of both of time and money is important when we talk about digitalization or industry 4.0. When the competitor is expanding in leaps and bounds digitalizing themselves and we on other hand handling the failures.
    Digital Transfomation using data, analytics & IoT helps to plan your downtime.

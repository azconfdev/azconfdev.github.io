    **Session : Say YES! to NoSQL: A Guide on When to Ditch Relational Databases**
sessiontitle: |
    If you're like many developers, relational databases are your bread and butter. They work (mostly) and are a logical solution to your application's data management needs. They've been the standard and that's what's always worked.

    And then...NoSQL databases came along. You may find that you're now in a spiral of questions: What is this? Is this better than a relational database? What do we need another database technology for? Does this mean there's no structured query language? Do I migrate my existing database to this model?

    In this talk, I'll answer these questions (and many more) to help you understand the what, how, and why of NoSQL databases as it relates to the modern applications we strive to build today. You'll leave with a definitive guide on NoSQL databases and be confident in deciding whether or not it is the right database solution for you!

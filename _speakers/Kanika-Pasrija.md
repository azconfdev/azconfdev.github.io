    **Session : Github actions - Setting Azure Infrastructure**
sessiontitle: |
    GitHub Actions is an end-to-end software development platform that offers a seamless code to cloud experience. By automating workflows, CI/CD, and other common tasks, Actions greatly simplifies and improves developer workflows and productivity.

    One of the scenarios where actions play a significant role is setting Azure infrastructure using code. We can use arm-deploy action for the same. Arm-deploy is a GitHub Action to deploy ARM templates which adds maturity to pipelines. In the session, we'll discuss about github actions, workflows and focus on arm-deploy action to setup azure infrastructure.

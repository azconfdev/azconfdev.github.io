    **Session : Simplify Microservices development with Tye**
sessiontitle: |
    Moving to microservices can accelerate your team’s software delivery by
    decoupling dependencies, but introduces a lot of new complications and
    decisions. One of the biggest problems is that it makes the development
    experience a lot more complex and confusing. How do I just do File / New /
    Microservice? Do I need to learn all these new terms and libraries just to
    get started? How do I debug my app, start up all the services and
    applications at the same time, discover services, or visualize all of the
    different components? And, seriously, just how much YAML do I need to
    write???
    
    Fortunately, there’s an easy way to get started that doesn’t lock you in or limit you from taking more direct control as your application matures: Project Tye.
    
    In this session, we’ll start with microservices basics, look at the tools and practices you’ll need to get started with microservices development, and then see how Project Tye can give you that File / New / Microservices experience in just a few minutes.

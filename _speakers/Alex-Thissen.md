    **Session : 	Dapr for building distributed .NET Core applications**
sessiontitle: |
    Modern distributed applications require much more than just application logic. Features such as state management for services, communication using publish/subscribe messaging and event driven binding to cloud resources might be needed. Dapr introduces a runtime to offer such building blocks, and is less invasive in your application, allowing you to pick-and-choose what you need. In this session we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You will also see what it takes to develop distributed applications in .NET Core using Dapr's features and how to bind to messaging infrastructure, cloud resources and use the actor programming model and client proxies. At the end you know what it takes to combine Dapr in your ASP.NET Core applications using routing, controllers or using gRPC clients.

    **Session : Towards an Evolutionary Architecture**
sessiontitle: |
    Big up front design is discouraged in agile development. However, we know that architecture plays a significant part in software systems. Evolving architecture during the development of an application seems to be a risky business. In this presentation, we will discuss the reasons to evolve the architecture, some of the core principles that can help us develop in such a manner, and the ways to minimize the risk and succeed in creating a practical and useful architecture.

    **Session :  Never miss the bus with Azure Function, IFTTT, Azure SQL and GeoSpatial data**

sessiontitle: |
    Public transportation is a blessing, but sometimes it can be a challenge. If I miss my bus, I might have to wait for 30 minutes to catch the next one. It would be great if someone could create a simple application that gets real-time bus information, also allowing the creation of geofence: when the bus enters that area, you know it’s time to leave the office. You can catch the bus right on time and never have to wait for the next one! I’ve been using it for more than a year now and it…just works. Like magic.

    With the aid of Azure Function, Azure SQL and a service like IFTTT, creating such solutions is fun, and paves the way for improvements and integrations that make people’s lives easier.
    In this session we’ll analyze the solution from the inside out.

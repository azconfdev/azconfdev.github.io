    **Session: eShop on Dapr: Build microservice applications the easy way**
sessiontitle: |
    Dapr is an open-source, event-driven, portable runtime for building microservices. It provides powerful building blocks to make it easy for developers to build resilient microservice applications using a variety of languages and frameworks.

    In this session, we'll introduce the Dapr building blocks and show how they can be applied to 'eShop on Containers'; a .NET microservices reference application. You'll learn about both the benefits and the limitations of using Dapr in your microservice applications.

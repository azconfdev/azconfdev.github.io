    **Session : Running VM workload on Kubernetes using KubeVirt**
sessiontitle: |
    Kubernetes Project was started to orchestrate containers only but over time it evolved now it can orchestrate serverless and VM workload as well. It has truly become a general-purpose orchestrator to run a mixed workload, which is a real need for many companies.

    In this session, I'll provide the introduction to the KubeVirt project using which we can orchestrate VM workload along with container workload on Kubernetes and give few demos along on how we are using in production.

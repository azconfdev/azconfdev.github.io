   Azure Data Factory is a cloud-native ETL service built for all data integration needs and skill levels.  You can easily construct ETL and ELT processes code-free or write your code.  It is serverless so you can focus on your integration logic rather than infrastructure management.  Because of the great flexibility ADF provides, customers are using ADF in a wide variety of use cases. It integrates with cloud-native security mechanisms to offer real enterprise-grade security.

    **Session :  Supercharge your App Service to a Global scale**
sessiontitle: |
    When architecting applications today, making then globally available is the standard. When designing the infrastructure for a new application we need to start from the premises that we have a global disperse customer base. This is a good challenge for Azure Architects. Creating global applications is no easy piece, we can hit a lot of concerns, not only technical but also business related and even legal.

    In this session, we will check how Azure App Service can helps us reach this global application goal and how other related services, like: Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager, Azure Storage, Azure CDN, Azure Functions, Cognitive Search, Azure Redis Caches, Cosmos DB and messaging services can help you to create a global scale application. Expect a heavily-demo depended session, based on the real-world experience in implementing this services in several customers.

    I am an experienced technical leader and an architect with a background in many different programming languages, technologies, and platforms. I have worked more than 17 years successfully at the highest level across several domains including manufacturing, banking, telecoms, and Marine. Because of my technical expertise and the ability to reach performance goals consistently, I have been promoted from the technical role to the management role.

    As a person, I'm a leader as well as a good team player with strong social and communication skills.

    **Session : Managing SIEM And SOAR using Azure Sentinel**    
sessiontitle: |
    Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel, as a cloud security solution can play in securing enterprise.

    In the past years, enterprises were forwarding security alerts to their on-premise SIEM solution as part of their cloud security strategy. However, some of these tools were struggling to keep pace with the increasing volume and variety of data they process. Some of the common issues were inability of their SIEMs to scale and the volume of alerts they must investigate.

    Azure Sentinel is a central place to analyze your security data, across all parts of your environment. Using the dashboards technology already available in Azure, Sentinel can provide a single pane of glass on the security of your environment.

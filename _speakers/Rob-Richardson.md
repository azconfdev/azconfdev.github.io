    **Session : At The Helm of Kubernetes: Repeatable Infrastructure Creation for Mere Mortals**
sessiontitle: |
    As we get deeper into Kubernetes yaml files, we see a lot of duplication. Can we move to a higher level that eliminates this duplication? Let's look at Helm, a tool both for templating k8s yaml files and for installing complex infrastructure dependencies as one package. With Helm 3, we now have deeper integration and more security when working with Kubernetes. Join us on this path to a simpler, more repeatable, and more discoverable yaml experience.

    **Session : Eliminate extra dependencies : State management for React apps with hooks**
sessiontitle: |
    Have you ever encountered an extremely appealing, reusable control but totally difficult to consume due to numerous external dependencies?

    We certainly did, and hence created a bag of reusable components using simple react constructs like hooks, context thus eliminating the need of external dependencies for state management.

    Over the years React has evolved a lot from being a library to serve the V(View part) of MVC framework to as powerful as being able to completely control the whole life cycle of your app. With introduction of hooks in React 16, react today can do much more than just rendering your UI. It has grown so powerful that you can totally eliminate the use of any other state management libraries whole together. All we need to do to go there, is just re imagine our apps and rethink how we can utilize the simple React constructs to achieve the same.

    In this session we would like to share our experience of building complex components which needed a complete state management library, yet we eliminated all the external dependencies with the help of simple React constructs like hooks and context and creating a Redux like pattern with just react.

    **Session: Distributed Messaging patterns**
sessiontitle: |
    Distributed systems are composed of a collection of services that each have their own roles and requirements. As we’re designing these systems, it’s important for us to understand how we communicate with these services and also how they communicate with each other.

    In this session, we will explore some of the options for communicating between distributed services. We’ll see some of the standard protocols and patterns that we can all use today, regardless of whether you’re running in the cloud, on-premises or a little of both.

    Hi, I am Daron.

    Starting from the kid who wrote QBasic, it’s been a long journey. My years spanned out across client app dev, back-end, cloud, and who knows where it will go. I led engineering teams at multiple startups and organizations in various sizes during the way.

    The desire to share what I discover resulted in me being a public speaker in various events and conferences. I figured I love it! Microsoft calls me a [MVP][1] and [RD][2] for 12 years now. My recent love is Serverless!

    If you want to have me in an event of yours, feel free to look at the [past events] I spoke to get a feel of what I can talk about :)

    **Session :  Function Orchestration in the world of Serverless**
sessiontitle: |
    You have a function, or two, or maybe more? Now is the time to talk about making sure you have full control on how data and communication flows between your functions. You need something to control how your functions interact to each other. You need something that can give you granular control, or sometimes maybe a simple user interface to get it done. This session is about your options in Azure to accomplish all that. We will look into Durable Functions and Logic Apps to understand where they can help us scaling our serverless move.

    I'm a jack-of-all-trades, splitting my time between writing code and wearing other hats for my startup (cloudskew.com). Ex-MSFT. Trying to be an active tweeter [https://twitter.com/mithunshanbhag][1] and blogger [https://mithunshanbhag.github.io/][2] these days.

    **Session :  How I built cloudskew.com on Azure**

sessiontitle: |
    I'll talk about lessons learnt, key decisions & tradeoffs made while building cloudskew.com (an online editor for creating cloud architecture diagrams). The architecture of cloudskew is publicly documented: [https://assets.cloudskew.com/assets/misc/cloudskew-architecture-20200116.png][1]

    Some topics I'll touch upon:
    - Why PaaS + Serverless instead of IaaS?
    - Horizontal auto-scaling.
    - Queue based load-levelling.
    - Centralized configuration management
    - Debouncing calls to server
    - Continuous Integration vs deployment vs release
    - Upcoming architectural changes to handle scale

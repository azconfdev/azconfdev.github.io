    **Session : Simplifying Blockchain with the help of Cloud**
sessiontitle: |
    Blockchain has become a pivotal technology in the way it has revolutionized the industry. Starting from Decentralized finance, Supply chain management to Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain has shown immense potential to manage transactions across various domains. One of the drawbacks when it comes to working with blockchain is the bandwidth required to deploy your own network and perform operations on it. This is where cloud can make a big difference. Cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure have built Blockchain offerings in a short span of time to address the challenges faced by developers during deployment and operations. With cloud offerings like Azure Blockchain service, everything is available at one-click.

    This talk is designed for beginners, where I will introduce blockchain and also talk about how blockchain network deployment and operations can be simplified using Azure Blockchain Service.

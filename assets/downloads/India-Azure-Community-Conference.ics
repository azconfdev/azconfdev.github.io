SUMMARY:Say YES! to NoSQL: A Guide on When to Ditch Relational Databases by Adrienne Tacke
DESCRIPTION:If you're like many developers\, relational databases are your bread and butter. They work (mostly) and are a logical solution to your application's data management needs. They've been the standard and that's what's always worked. And then...NoSQL databases came along. You may find that you're now in a spiral of questions: What is this? Is this better than a relational database? What do we need another database technology for? Does this mean there's no structured query language? Do I migrate my existing database to this model? In this talk\, I'll answer these questions (and many more) to help you understand the what\, how\, and why of NoSQL databases as it relates to the modern applications we strive to build today. You'll leave with a definitive guide on NoSQL databases and be confident in deciding whether or not it is the right database solution for you!

SUMMARY:How to automate network security for your Azure functions by Dushyant Priyadarshee
DESCRIPTION:Azure functions can be kept secured with restricted access setup or Azure AD based authentication etc. We will see some basic access control to secure an Azure function. Then we will use dotnet based Azure function as an example to describe an ecosystem. There will be few Azure tech introductions e.g. Azure event grid\, resource graph explorer etc and few demos with a dotnet core Azure function. Overall we will discuss and design the architecture of a system automating the network security for the ecosystem with multiple Azure functions. This idea can be spanned to a more complex environment\, we might touch on that.

SUMMARY:Simplifying Blockchain with the help of Cloud by Gnana Lakshmi
DESCRIPTION:Blockchain has become a pivotal technology in the way it has revolutionized the industry. Starting from Decentralized finance\, Supply chain management to Self Sovereign Identity\, blockchain has shown immense potential to manage transactions across various domains. One of the drawbacks when it comes to working with blockchain is the bandwidth required to deploy your own network and perform operations on it. This is where cloud can make a big difference. Cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure have built Blockchain offerings in a short span of time to address the challenges faced by developers during deployment and operations. With cloud offerings like Azure Blockchain service\, everything is available at one-click. This talk is designed for beginners\, where I will introduce blockchain and also talk about how blockchain network deployment and operations can be simplified using Azure Blockchain Service.

SUMMARY:Event-driven autoscaling on Kubernetes with KEDA and Azure Functions by Erwin Staal
DESCRIPTION:Event-driven\, serverless architectures are a hot topic in today�s cloud-native application development. To take full advantage of the serverless benefits of event-driven\, your application needs to scale and react to those events instantly. It needs to be able to scale from zero to potentially thousands of instances. KEDA is an open-sourced component that provides event-driven autoscaling for your Kubernetes workloads. KEDA works with any container\, but to enable additional serverless capabilities within Kubernetes you can pair KEDA with the Azure Functions runtime. Don't get fooled by 'Azure' in the name. Azure Functions provides a programming model that can run anywhere: in a container running on-premises\, fully managed in Azure\, or in any Kubernetes cluster and they can be written in many languages. It allows application developers not to worry anymore about writing the code to connect\, trigger\, and pull from an event source like RabbitMQ\, Kafka\, or Azure Event Hubs. That�s all handled for you. In this demo-filled session\, we will start with a quick introduction to both Kubernetes and Azure Functions. You will then see how you can create your first cluster and install KEDA\, deploy a function and scale that to thousands of instances based on events.

SUMMARY:Managing SIEM And SOAR using Azure Sentinel by Keshav Jain
DESCRIPTION:Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable\, cloud-native\, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel\, as a cloud security solution can play in securing enterprise. In the past years\, enterprises were forwarding security alerts to their on-premise SIEM solution as part of their cloud security strategy. However\, some of these tools were struggling to keep pace with the increasing volume and variety of data they process. Some of the common issues were inability of their SIEMs to scale and the volume of alerts they must investigate. Azure Sentinel is a central place to analyze your security data\, across all parts of your environment. Using the dashboards technology already available in Azure\, Sentinel can provide a single pane of glass on the security of your environment.

SUMMARY:Deployment Certifications at Scale on AKS with Azure Policy and Azure Functions by Rahul Rai\, Tarun Pabbi
DESCRIPTION:Do you know that your Kubernetes cluster can talk to you? And that too\, with voice or SMS messages? Controlling resource deployments on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster can quickly become challenging\, particularly when multiple Continuous Delivery pipelines target the same cluster. In such scenarios\, you want to build smarts within the Kubernetes cluster to admit or deny pods that do not meet your admission criteria. With Azure Policy for AKS\, you can write static admission rules for your Kubernetes cluster. But what if your admission demands are dynamic or you want to roll out custom admission policies? By creating custom admission webhooks for Kubernetes\, you can define custom policies that regulate the deployment of resources to a cluster. In this session\, we will present how you can administer Azure Policies for AKS and subsequently build a serverless validating admission webhook with Azure Functions to apply governance policies on the deployments in Kubernetes. Azure Functions allow you to integrate with external services without writing a single line of integration code. We will use the Azure Function�s native Twilio binding to send SMS updates on Kubernetes deployments to the Ops/SRE team. After participating in this session\, you will understand how easy it is to write custom validating webhooks for Kubernetes. Also\, you will learn to build and deploy a serverless infrastructure to certify deployments at scale.

DESCRIPTION:Come and join why WAF maters to you be it a Developer or Architect or DevOps. Running Day1 job on Azure or any cloud is easy but Day2 onwards require certain maturity and best practices to leverage the fullest potential. We will be learning the pillars of WAF with demos to visualize better. I am sure\, you will start implement some of them on the same day once you the gap. Cloud is a moving target as they keep improvise or update the stuff all the time. How can someone tell me cloud adoption maturity and comment the gap? I know it may looks like a consultation work and taxing but trust me\, its so easy to learn WAF and implement them to reap the benefits.

SUMMARY:Never miss the bus with Azure Function\, IFTTT\, Azure SQL and GeoSpatial data by Davide Mauri
DESCRIPTION:Public transportation is a blessing\, but sometimes it can be a challenge. If I miss my bus\, I might have to wait for 30 minutes to catch the next one. It would be great if someone could create a simple application that gets real-time bus information\, also allowing the creation of geofence: when the bus enters that area\, you know it�s time to leave the office. You can catch the bus right on time and never have to wait for the next one! I�ve been using it for more than a year now and it�just works. Like magic. With the aid of Azure Function\, Azure SQL and a service like IFTTT\, creating such solutions is fun\, and paves the way for improvements and integrations that make people�s lives easier. In this session we�ll analyze the solution from the inside out.

SUMMARY:Building better security for your API platform using Azure API Management by Eldert Grootenboer
DESCRIPTION:These days we use APIs to expose all our microservices \, processes\, and data\, and all this while working in a PaaS or serverless environment. But how do we ensure this is done in a secure and governed way? This is where Azure API Management comes in\, where we can create a repository of all our APIs\, and make sure to expose all of these securely in a standardized manner. In this session we will dive into the most common security hazards\, and see how API Management helps us solve these. You will learn all about the strengths and weaknesses of the product\, best practices\, and how to harden the defenses of your services.

SUMMARY:Dapr for building distributed .NET Core applications by Alex Thissen
DESCRIPTION:Modern distributed applications require much more than just application logic. Features such as state management for services\, communication using publish/subscribe messaging and event driven binding to cloud resources might be needed. Dapr introduces a runtime to offer such building blocks\, and is less invasive in your application\, allowing you to pick-and-choose what you need. In this session we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture\, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You will also see what it takes to develop distributed applications in .NET Core using Dapr's features and how to bind to messaging infrastructure\, cloud resources and use the actor programming model and client proxies. At the end you know what it takes to combine Dapr in your ASP.NET Core applications using routing\, controllers or using gRPC clients.

SUMMARY:Plan your unplanned downtime by Anchal Bhandari
DESCRIPTION:We find large number of manufacturers and industries\, failing or spending huge amount of money due to unexpected downtime. The machines shuts creating the entire line on shop floor inactive\, thereby stopping production or assembly in assembly lines. This results in halt in production\, calling maintenance engineer for corrective solution\, adding new machines if earlier cant be repaired and might be missing customer deadline. This loss of both of time and money is important when we talk about digitalization or industry 4.0. When the competitor is expanding in leaps and bounds digitalizing themselves and we on other hand handling the failures. Digital Transfomation using data\, analytics & IoT helps to plan your downtime.
